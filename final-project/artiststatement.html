                <h4>I created a webpage using HTML, CSS, and Javascript (with the p5.play, buttons.js, scenemanager.js and p5.sound.js libraries) in order to create an interactive two player puzzle/obstacle course game. In addition to the complicated, timed, and intricate level design, I mapped the player controls to seemingly arbitrary inputs. In reality, the inputs were strategically selected in order to make completing the game exceedingly more difficult without a 2nd player.</h4>
                <h4><span>The purpose behind this webpage is to literally and figuratively bring people together. I believe that there are moments and situations in life where it is better navigated with more than just yourself. Throughout the game, there are moments where both players must work together or help each other. I strategically made the game with those moments in mind in order to speak on a larger dialogue of working together. Together the two players must figure out a comfortable way to play, in terms of navigating the input system, while simultaneously strategizing and exploring the level for the way to escape. I added color coordination to certain areas of the level in order to give hints on who should be where and when.</span></h4>
                <h4>Overall, the interaction between the two players from the controls to the game loop capture the rawest form of collaboration. The players have to work together in order to successfully complete the level. No player left behind. I strive to capture this experience from my game, in order to spread the message that someone can help and vice versa.</h4>
